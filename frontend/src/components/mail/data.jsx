This is a good thing, but it would be legendary if it could analyze YouTube videos based on comments, titles and descriptions, and even better, analyze the images in the video.

Example Application component, business process, technological node, etc. This is the strength of this language - it is clear at first glance what type of element it is. Furthermore, in the links between elements, different types of links are used - which expresses their relationship. They also have a specific graphic expression such as: association, aggregation, composition, realization, serving, etc.\n\nDo you know if there is already an AI solution that uses the ArchiMate notation, according to the OpenGoup standard?",

So not only is OpenAI not playing the game, they aren't considerate of productive society-empowering design or even ethics.  If its 'Open' that means anyone can train it, and improve it.  Thats #1 .. If it's GOOD for society, then thats through an act of contributive actions and feedback by means of the public.  Thats the whole 'get' and 'getting' AI.\n\nBeing closed is essentially blocking the light of good design.  Over time, that model falls away.  You aren't at the 6o'clock mark on that, it's 20 years past notice.  Open source started being the future in the 1980's.\n\nThe majority of ethical AI designers do not believe in an omittance of all models and data.  You cannot 'Trust' AI if its not reproducible in training by others. \n\nOpenAI's founding is to produce trust in AI systems, and they are doing the opposite!  That's quite appalling. We cannot trust what we cannot measure and willingly contribute to.\n\nClearly, any random person, or Elon can change this.",

Without a sign-up process, how can users trust that their interactions are being handled responsibly and their data is being protected? Instant access could potentially lead to misuse or abuse of the AI, without proper oversight or accountability measures in place. Additionally, without user authentication, there's no way to ensure that the AI is being used by legitimate individuals or organizations. Overall, while the concept may seem appealing on the surface, there are important considerations regarding privacy and trust that need to be addressed.  \n#AI",

        "Probably not the most conventional place for a question, but as they say, the perfect is the enemy of the good! So, hello OpenAI and community from a comment under your post.  I've created a plugin called JudgeAI based on GPT-4 with a big dream: to fully automate the legal proceedings. The idea is simple  the entire process of evidence evaluation and decision-making should follow the logical legal algorithms I've developed, written in natural language, while the pretraining data should only be used to extract information from documents.\nThe challenge is that GPTs sometimes don't understand when to use pre-training data for analysis and when it's necessary to strictly follow the algorithm. I've tried breaking the algorithm into stages, rewriting it for clarity, and creating separate guides for the plugin indicating where the use of pre-training data is permissible and where strict adherence to the algorithm is required. But the improvements weren't significant.\nMy question to you is: how can I get GPTs to more clearly distinguish the moments when it should act as an LLM, and when it should perform a specific sequence of actions according to my algorithm? Perhaps some of you have had a similar experience or thoughts on this matter?",
